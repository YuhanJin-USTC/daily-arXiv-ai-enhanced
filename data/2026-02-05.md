Abstract: Ultra-relativistic quantum-electrodynamic (QED) plasmas, characterized by magnetic field strengths approaching and even exceeding the Schwinger field of approximately $B_{Q} \approx 4 \times 10^{13}$ gauss, hold significant interest for laser-plasma experiments and astrophysical observations of neutron stars and magnetars. In this study, we investigate the joint modification of normal plasma modes in ultra-relativistic electron-positron plasmas, both charge neutral and non-neutral, by the super-strong magnetic field and plasma relativistic temperature. Our analysis shows that the most substantial modification concerns the reduction of the plasma frequency cutoff, resulting in relativistic and field-induced transparency. Additionally, we observe a temperature-independent modification of the index of refraction of electromagnetic waves, which coincides with the behavior observed in a cold QED plasma.

Abstract: This study reexamines the excitation of ion-acoustic precursor solitons by a supersonically moving charged debris object, incorporating two previously overlooked physical factors: the dynamic charging of the debris and the impermeable nature of its surface. The influence of charging dynamics is explored using an enhanced one-dimensional fluid-Poisson model, where the source charge is treated as a dynamical variable and solved self-consistently alongside the core plasma equations. By comparing these results with prior fixed-charge models, we evaluate the effects on soliton onset and propagation, finding that charging dynamics does not hinder soliton generation or evolution. To assess the impact of the impermeability of debris surface, a two-dimensional fluid model simulates the interaction between an electrostatically biased, impenetrable object and a flowing plasma. Modeling the object as an infinite wall disconnects the upstream and downstream plasma regions, forming a sheath without solitons -- consistent with earlier fluid and particle-in-cell simulations. However, replacing the wall with a finite object enables plasma flow around it, restoring upstream-downstream connectivity and naturally generating precursor solitons.

Abstract: We present a statistical mechanics framework for modeling non-equilibrium transport coefficients using the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE). We show that the kernel, obtained via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) from the stochastic force autocorrelation measured in a thermal equilibrium state, is sufficient to model the dynamics of the system in a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS). This approach provides a computationally efficient path to modeling complex transport problems. We apply this framework to the canonical problem of test particle drag in a uniform plasma. The GLE formalism is shown to naturally capture non-Markovian phenomena through the moments of the kernel, including an effective mass renormalization and oscillatory relaxation. We demonstrate that the standard Chandrasekhar stopping power formula arises naturally as the Markovian limit of this equilibrium memory kernel. These theoretical predictions are quantitatively validated by direct Particle-in-Cell simulations, which confirm the predicted oscillatory structure of the memory kernel. This work thus establishes a practical method for predicting non-equilibrium transport properties from first-principles equilibrium simulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-fidelity scientific simulations are now producing unprecedented amounts of data, creating a storage and analysis bottleneck. A single simulation can generate tremendous data volumes, often forcing researchers to discard valuable information. A prime example of this is plasma turbulence described by the gyrokinetic equations: nonlinear, multiscale, and 5D in phase space. It constitutes one of the most computationally demanding frontiers of modern science, with runs taking weeks and yielding tens of terabytes of data dumps.The increasing storage demands underscore the importance of compression. However, reconstructed snapshots do not necessarily preserve essential physical quantities. We present a spatiotemporal evaluation pipeline, accounting for structural phenomena and multi-scale transient fluctuations to assess the degree of physical fidelity. Indeed, we find that various compression techniques lack preservation of both spatial mode structure and temporal turbulence characteristics. Therefore, we explore Physics-Informed Neural Compression (PINC), which incorporates physics-informed losses tailored to gyrokinetics and enables extreme compressions ratios of over 70,000x. Entropy coding on top of PINC further pushes it to 120,000x. This direction provides a viable and scalable solution to the prohibitive storage demands of gyrokinetics, enabling post-hoc analyses that were previously infeasible.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a Navier-Stokes-driven analysis of the mean and fluctuating wall shear stress (WSS) applied to turbulent channel flow data from direct numerical simulations at friction Reynolds numbers up to $Re_τ\approx 2000$. Starting from the streamwise momentum equation, we derive exact integral equations that relate the square plane-average and the square fluctuating WSS to wall-normal integrals of terms combining shear with acceleration, shear with pressure-radient, and shear with viscous diffusion. The square plane-average WSS can be well approximated by the product of plane-average shear and plane-average acceleration integrated over the buffer layer with corrections from the mean pressure gradient which diminish as the reciprocal of the Reynolds number. The square fluctuating WSS is similarly well approximated by the shear-acceleration and shear-pressure-gradient covariances integrated over the buffer layer, but the latter increases in magnitude with Reynolds number and is therefore not negligible. The acceleration fluctuations around the plane-average acceleration consist of a local Eulerian fluctuating acceleration, an advective acceleration and a term which gives rise a turbulence production contribution to the shear-acceleration covariance. By Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis the Eulerian acceleration and the streamwise mean advection part of the advective acceleration cancel each other. The shear-acceleration covariance is characterised by a near-wall peak which results from turbulence production and, more specifically, sweeps.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks provide a meshfree framework for solving partial differential equations by embedding governing physical laws directly into the training process. However, most PINNs developed for fluid dynamics remain restricted to fixed flow parameters, requiring retraining for each new condition and limiting their usefulness as general purpose solvers. In this work, we develop a parameterized PINNs formulation for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in which the Reynolds number (Re) is treated as an explicit network input, enabling a single trained model to represent a continuous family of flow solutions. The approach is demonstrated using the 2D lid driven cavity flow as a canonical benchmark. For low Re, where the flow is laminar and diffusion dominated, pure PINNs trained solely using the governing equations and boundary conditions accurately reproduce velocity and pressure fields across a wide range of Re, including cases not explicitly sampled during training. As the Re increases and the flow becomes increasingly convection dominated, the predictive accuracy of pure PINNs deteriorates due to stiffness and optimization imbalance. To address this limitation, a hybrid framework is introduced that combines transfer learning with sparse supervision from high fidelity CFD data. The resulting parameterized PINNs model accurately captures the Re dependence of the flow over both interpolation and limited extrapolation regimes while requiring CFD data only over a narrow subset of the parameter space. Detailed comparisons with OpenFOAM simulations demonstrate strong agreement in velocity profiles, and pressure fields. The results show that incorporating governing parameters directly into PINNs enables the construction of parametric Navier Stokes solvers, offering a promising route toward efficient reduced order modeling and data assisted simulation of fluid flows.

Abstract: We investigate how the rotational nature of turbulence affects learned mappings between quantities governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. By varying the degree of anisotropy in a turbulence dataset, we explore how statistical symmetry affects these mappings. To do this, we train super-resolution models at different wall-normal locations in a channel flow, where anisotropy varies naturally, and test their generalization. By evaluating the learned mappings on new coordinate frames and new flow conditions, we find that coordinate-frame generalization is a key part of the generalization problem. Turbulent flows naturally present a wide range of local orientations, so respecting the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations improves generalization to new flows. Importantly, turbulence's rotational structure can embed these symmetries into learned mappings -- an effect that strengthens with isotropy and dataset size. This is because a more isotropic dataset samples a wider range of orientations, more fully covering the rotational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. The dependence on isotropy means equivariance error is also scale-dependent, consistent with Kolmogorov's hypothesis. Therefore, turbulence provides its own data augmentation (we term this implicit data augmentation). We expect this effect to apply broadly to learned mappings between tensorial flow quantities, making it relevant to most machine learning applications in turbulence.

Abstract: We introduce a topology-preserving discretization for coupling incompressible fluids with thin deformable structures, achieving guaranteed leakproofness through preservation of fluid domain connectivity. Our approach leverages a stitching algorithm applied to a clipped Voronoi diagram generated from Lagrangian fluid particles, in order to maintain path connectivity around obstacles. This geometric discretization naturally conforms to arbitrarily thin structures, enabling boundary conditions to be enforced exactly at fluid-solid interfaces. By discretizing the pressure projection equations on this conforming mesh, we can enforce velocity boundary conditions at the interface for the fluid while applying pressure forces directly on the solid boundary, enabling sharp two-way coupling between phases. The resulting method prevents fluid leakage through solids while permitting flow wherever a continuous path exists through the fluid domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on diverse scenarios including flows around thin membranes, complex geometries with narrow passages, and deformable structures immersed in liquid, showcasing robust two-way coupling without artificial sealing or leakage artifacts.

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of cold plasma equations taking into account electron-ion collisions in both relativistic and nonrelativistic cases. It is known that for a constant collision coefficient $ν$, the solution to the Cauchy problem for such a system can lose smoothness. However, if the dependence of $ν$ on the electron density $N$ is more than linear, then the solution remains globally smooth for any initial data. However, the appearance of the dependence $ν(N)$ leads to a change in the type of the system, it loses hyperbolicity, which leads to computational problems. In this paper, we propose a new implicit solution method in Euler variables that overcomes these difficulties. It can be used in both nonrelativistic and relativistic cases and is tested for the threshold case of a linear dependence $ν(N)=ν_1+ν_0 N$, when smoothness can still be lost. The computational experiments carried out are in full agreement with the available theoretical results.

Abstract: The success of the transistor as the cornerstone of digital computation motivates analogous efforts to identify an equivalent hardware primitive, the probabilistic bit or p-bit, for the emerging paradigm of probabilistic computing. Here, we uncover a fundamental ubiquity in the stochastic dynamics of double well energy systems when initialized near the barrier top. Using a topological framework grounded in Morse theory and singularity theory, we make use of the result that all smooth, even double well potentials reduce near the saddle point to a canonical quartic normal form. Within this regime, the interplay of noise, synaptic bias, and potential curvature produces a topologically robust short time evolution characterized by a tanh like response. This enables Boltzmann like sampling that is largely independent of the detailed shape of the potential, apart from its effective temperature scaling. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations across multiple representative systems corroborate this behavior. Our work provides a unifying foundation for assessing and engineering a broad class of physical platforms, including oscillators, bistable latches, and magnetic devices, as p-bits operating within a synchronous framework for stochastic sampling and probabilistic computation.

Abstract: Superdirective (supergain) antennas aim to produce a narrow main beam from radiators that are electrically small compared with the wavelength. Instead of enlarging the physical aperture, they rely on strongly coupled currents, near-field energy storage, and controlled modal interference so that a compact structure radiates with enhanced directivity. This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion.

Abstract: Finite, lossy waveguides are ubiquitous: distributed attenuation with partial reflections produces feedback, resonance, delays and decay across electromagnetic, acoustic, photonic, quantum-transport and electrochemical interfaces. Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\mathcal{U}^2-\mathcal{S}^2=|Γ_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|Γ_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|Γ_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH. This framework provides a transferable design language for dissipative, boundary-controlled systems.

Abstract: Light source is a foundational to photonic science and technology. However, a significant challenge remains in generating and distributing coherent light from a single on-chip source with high phase stability across multiple channels. Integrated lasers typically operate independently, and conventional splitters (e.g., multi-mode interferometers) do not guarantee the phase coherence required for advanced applications. Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue. The evolution of the null space maps to real-space rotation described by the special orthogonal group SO(N), thus enabling precise and scalable control over light distribution by engineering the system parameters. We experimentally realize up to one-to-nine equipartition of light on a waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic chip. The framework can be upscaled for one-to-N light distribution. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for integrated coherent light sources, paving the way for integrated photonic applications such as quantum photonics and optical computing.

Abstract: We use camera-in-the-loop calibration to calibrate a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) in a far-field hologram setup. The recorded intensity distributions achieve a high degree of consistency with the calculated results, indicating a precise calibration and sufficient modeling of the most prominent aberrations. In this work, we discuss the modeled aberrations and examine the improvement or loss in image quality and diffraction efficiency that is obtained by including or excluding the modeled aberrations in the calibration. We further show the influence of aberrations on speckle-reduced holograms and evaluate the speckle contrast.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of harmonic confinement in a finite optical superlattice and reveal the different mechanisms that can lead to the emergence of localized states. The optical superlattice, with odd or even number of unit cells, can exhibit either a trivial or a non-trivial underlying topology, characterized by the corresponding Zak phase. We focus on a distinct localization mechanism in the intermediate harmonic trapping frequency regime. Specifically, the four lowest-lying eigenstates in this regime form an effective four-level system in the topologically non-trivial configuration. Larger trapping frequency values drive the system into a harmonic trap dominated regime, featuring classical pairing and localization of all states of the lower band, as in a usual optical lattice. For the lower trapping frequency regime, the fate of topological edge states is discussed. Our results are based on exact diagonalization and on a tight-binding approximation that maps the continuous to a discrete system. We address several aspects relevant to the experimental implementation of optical superlattices and provide a brief illustration of the dynamics, highlighting direct ways to observe and distinguish between the different localization mechanisms.

Abstract: Structured light offers a promising solution for the increasing data demands of modern optical networks, opening up new degrees of freedom that can be leveraged for greater channel capacity and more bits per photon. However, its implementation is hindered by real-world distortions, for example, atmospheric turbulence in free-space, with severe and rapidly evolving phase perturbations that alter the amplitude, phase and vectorial polarization structure of the beam. Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (>98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested. Our work is the first to demonstrate the potential for optical topologies as reliable and robust information carriers in a real-world environment and points to the potential for other complex channels too, offering attractive features for classical and quantum communication alike.

Abstract: Ultrafast mid-infrared (MIR) imaging is a key enabling capability for monitoring transient thermal and plasma phenomena in scientific diagnostics and industrial safety. However, conventional cryogenic MIR cameras face a fundamental trade-off between frame rate, noise, and pixel format. Here we report a passive, incoherent MIR imaging platform that leverages sum-frequency upconversion in chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPLN) to translate broadband 3--5um scenes to the near-infrared, enabling ultrafast acquisition on a silicon-based intensified CCD (iCCD). In fast-kinetics mode we achieve a physical frame rate of 100kHz with microsecond-scale gate control, and we directly capture the full evolution of an air-breakdown electric arc, resolving its rapid ignition, expansion, and decay dynamics. Beyond demonstrating ultrafast passive imaging, we introduce a drift-aware calibration workflow based on Allan deviation analysis to quantitatively select the gate width and averaging strategy under realistic slow-drift and multiplicative noise. This combined capability -- ultrafast passive MIR imaging plus operationally meaningful calibration -- provides a practical route toward real-time thermal surveillance and early-warning systems for hazardous fast transients.

Abstract: This industrial Ph.D. project, carried out in collaboration between Radiometer Medical ApS and SDU Centre for Photonics Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark, explored the use of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) for the purposes of differential white blood cell counts (dWBCs) in point-of-care (PoC) devices for acute care settings. Two DHM prototypes were developed; an initial lens-based system serving as the foundation for algorithm development, and experimental validation of the approach, achieving 89.6% classification accuracy on a 3-part differential, and a subsequent lensless system for simplified design and increased field-of-view (FoV). Both prototypes employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cell classification. With further optimizations, the lensless system achieved classification accuracies of 92.65% and 89.44% on the 3-part and 5-part differential, respectively. With the lensless system, the derivation of the monocyte distribution width (MDW), a biomarker for sepsis, was also demonstrated.
  Additionally, pixel super-resolution and multi-wavelength DHM approaches were investigated to enhance the obtained cell information. Finally, a proof-of-principle physics-informed neural network (PINN) for holographic reconstruction was implemented, demonstrating the potential for machine learning (ML) reconstruction techniques.
  In summary, this work represents an initial exploration of DHM for dWBC in PoC devices, laying the groundwork for future research.

Abstract: High-reflective crystalline $GaAs/Al_{0.92}Ga_{0.08}As$ coatings show reduced Brownian noise compared to conventional dielectric coatings. However, several ultra stable laser systems observed additional noise sources that hinder the realization of the expected improvements in frequency stability. These additional noise sources are related to the birefringence of the coatings and its modification by intracavity light. The origin of the birefringence is not yet well understood and its modification via illumination remains unexplained. Here we present an extensive study on the steady-state and transient modification of the birefringence by intracavity light and by uniform illumination at various wavelengths using an optical cavity at room temperature. We find a unified description that suggests a primary two-photon process for photon energies below the bandgap of GaAs, or a single-photon process at higher energies. Adding external illumination allows to reduce noise induced by laser power fluctuations by balancing the photo-thermal-optic response of the mirrors and the photo-birefringent effect at a more favorable low intracavity power.

Abstract: Mask-based lensless imagers use simple optics and computational reconstruction to design compact form factor cameras with compressive imaging ability. However, these imagers generally suffer from poor reconstruction quality. Here, we describe several advances in both hardware and software that result in improved lensless imaging quality. First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers.

Abstract: We consider tunnel ionization of atomic argon in a femtosecond laser pulse of intensity $10^{21}-10^{22}{\rm W/cm}^2$ aiming to investigate the relativistic dynamics and radiation of photoelectrons released from their parent ions inside the laser focus. Radiation of such electrons accelerated along the laser field propagation direction appears to have moderate power but can be considerably enhanced by a collision with a relatively weak counter-propagating laser pulse. Using the theory of laser-induced tunneling in atoms and ions and that of nonlinear Thomson scattering, we demonstrate that angular distributions and spectra of emitted photons can serve as a probe of the peak intensity in the focus. The angular distribution of emitted radiation in the plane of polarization and propagation of the ionizing laser beam appears narrow and peaked around an intensity-dependent angle, making this ionization setup a source of collimated XUV radiation.
