In this work, a novel common-path interferometric approach to ODT is presented, specifically designed for the RI reconstruction of heterogeneous and highly scattering samples at high temporal stability. The proposed technique, termed lateral shearing (LS)-ODT, incorporates partial lateral shearing off-axis interferometry to suppress the effects of multiple scattering, similar to the mechanism in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, which is widely used for imaging thick specimens. Additionally, the LS-ODT system uses dynamic speckle illumination to enhance both spatial phase and RI sensitivity compared to laser-based ODT systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on a cell phantom. Its robustness and accuracy are further validated across a wide range of samples, including mouse kidney tissue sections and brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both thin and thick sections.

Computational prediction of this phenomenon is challenging due to the complex multiscale nature of blood. As a result, conventional approaches often fail to predict hemolysis accurately, commonly showing deviations of multiple orders of magnitude compared to experimental data. More accurate models are typically computationally expensive and thus impractical for real-world applications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting accurate yet simple and efficient computational hemolysis models.\n  Methods: Hemolysis modeling relies on two key components: a red blood cell model and a hemoglobin release model. In this work, we compare three red blood cell models: a common stress-based model (Bludszuweit), a simple strain-based model based on the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, and a more complex tensor-based model (TTM). Further, we compare two hemoglobin release models: the widely used power-law approach and a biophysical pore formation model.\n  Results: We evaluate these models in two benchmark cases: the FDA blood pump and the FDA nozzle. In both benchmarks, the simple strain-based model combined with the pore formation model achieves absolute predictions of hemolysis within the standard deviation of experimental measurements. In contrast, stress-based power law models deviate by several orders of magnitude.\n  Conclusion: The strain-based pore modeling approach takes into account the biophysical properties of red blood cell membranes, in particular their viscoelastic deformation behavior and hemoglobin release through membrane pores.

Here we study suction-induced entrainment in a prototypical confined system using high-fidelity coupled CFD-DEM simulations resolving unsteady gas flow and discrete particle motion with moving boundaries. By decomposing the forces on individual particles, we show that suction is not purely pressure-driven, but results from the combined action of pressure-gradient and unsteady drag forces generated by boundary-accelerated flow. Despite the heterogeneous and transient force fields, the final entrained mass is found to be governed primarily by a single energetic measure: the mechanical work performed on the particle assembly in the entrainment direction during boundary motion, rather than by peak instantaneous forces. Varying boundary kinematics demonstrates that changes in displacement or velocity history control entrainment mainly by modifying the duration over which fluid-particle forces perform work.

Our focus is the limit of a nearly-inviscid lubricant, where the ratio $\u03bc$ of the lubricant viscosity to that of the exterior fluid is small. This limit is singular for an encapsulated surface, indicating a dominant lubricant-flow effect - a stark contrast to superhydrophobic surfaces where the role of the lubricant is typically negligible.", "AI": {"tldr": "Effective slip length calculation for lubricant-encapsulated grooved surfaces with nearly-inviscid lubricant reveals dominant lubricant effects, contrasting with superhydrophobic surfaces.", "motivation": "To understand the hydrodynamic behavior of lubricant-encapsulated surfaces with rectangular grooves under shear flow, particularly in the limit of nearly-inviscid lubricants where viscosity ratio \u03bc is small.", "method": "Analytical calculation of effective slip length for periodic rectangular grooves fully wetted by lubricant, focusing on the singular limit of small viscosity ratio \u03bc between lubricant and exterior fluid.", "result": "The nearly-inviscid lubricant limit is singular for encapsulated surfaces, indicating dominant lubricant-flow effects, which contrasts sharply with superhydrophobic surfaces where lubricant effects are typically negligible.", "conclusion": "Lubricant-encapsulated surfaces exhibit fundamentally different hydrodynamic behavior from superhydrophobic surfaces, with lubricant playing a dominant role in the nearly-inviscid limit, highlighting the importance of considering lubricant effects in such systems."}}

The model, implemented using an artificial neural network, is trained on a direct numerical simulation database of compressible turbulent channel flows over rough walls. The dataset contains 372 cases spanning a wide range of irregular roughness topographies, including Gaussian and Weibull distributions, Mach numbers 0~3.3, and friction Reynolds numbers 180~2000. We employ an information-theoretic, dimensionless learning method to identify the inputs with the highest predictive power for the dimensionless wall friction and wall heat flux. Predictions are accompanied by a confidence score derived from a spectrally normalized neural Gaussian process, which quantifies uncertainty in regions that deviate from the training dataset. The model performance is first evaluated a-priori on 110 turbulent channel flow cases, yielding prediction errors below 4%. The model is assessed a-posteriori in wall-modeled large-eddy simulations across diverse test cases. These include over 160 subsonic and supersonic turbulent channel flows with rough walls, a transonic high-pressure turbine (HPT) blade with Gaussian roughness, a high-speed compression ramp with sandpaper roughness, and three hypersonic blunt bodies with sand-grain roughness. Results show that the proposed wall model typically achieves a-posteriori predictive accuracy within 10% for wall shear stress and within 15% for wall heat flux, with high confidence in the channel flows and HPT blade cases. In the rough-wall compression ramp and hypersonic blunt bodies, the model captures the heating augmentation with errors ranging 0%~20%. In the cases with the highest errors, the reduced performance is correctly detected by a drop in the confidence score.", "AI": {"tldr": "A neural network-based wall model for LES that incorporates surface roughness effects across low- to high-speed flows, trained on DNS data of rough-wall channel flows, with uncertainty quantification via confidence scores.", "motivation": "Current wall models for large-eddy simulation often lack comprehensive treatment of surface roughness effects across different flow regimes (low- to high-speed, transitional to fully rough), and typically don't provide uncertainty quantification for predictions in extrapolated conditions.", "method": "Developed a wall model using an artificial neural network trained on a DNS database of 372 compressible turbulent channel flows over rough walls with various topographies (Gaussian, Weibull distributions).
